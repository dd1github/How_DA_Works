# How_DA_Works
This repository provides python code and links to data sources that support several of the experiments in the paper, "Towards Understanding How Data Augmentation Works when Learning with Imbalanced Data," by Damien Dablain and Nitesh Chawla.

For single layer models, we used the SKLearn package. The data used in the support vector and logistic regression classifiers can be conveniently extracted from SKLearn fitted models with built-in functions. We have included sample extracted data in the attached links to reproduce representative experiments.
